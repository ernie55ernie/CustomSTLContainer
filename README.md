# CustomSTLContainer
<ol>
  <li>Try to enhance and experiment with RangeArray class. For example, add reverse iterators, rbegin(), and rend() functions.</li>
  <li>Try to optimize the container. For example, try allocating a little more memory than needed when constructing objects so that no all insert operations force a re-allocation.</li>
  <li>Try adding a constructor that takes a standard array and an index as the location of zero.</li>
  <li>Try using a vector, rather than a standard array, to hold the elements of the RangeArray.</li>
